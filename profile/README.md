============

[Domum Social](https://domum.social) is a privacy-focused microblogging and documentation hub
designed to let people speak freely without fear of reprisal.

Built on [Mastodon](https://github.com/mastodon/), it’s the only instance we know of
that *requires* [Tor](https://www.torproject.org)  based logins and sign ups -- so we literally can't know where
you’re posting from while still allowing viewing and interaction over
the regular public internet.

In addition to active moderation, we’re creating clear, easy-to-follow
guides to help users preserve their anonymity and critically assess
anonymous content.

**Our goal is to break echo chambers, rehumanize conversations, and make
unsafe topics safe to discuss.**
